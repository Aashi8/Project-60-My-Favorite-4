        <p>Through reading, one can travel from other part of the world with the wonder of words as if we are dreaming with our eyes wide open. We discover things unintentionally through written wisdoms of those who dream like us. And this is how books inspire us; human curiosity is a gift, we crave for knowledge and keep on searching for it.</p>
